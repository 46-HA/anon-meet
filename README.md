# Anon Meet

Anon Meet is for Hack Clubbers, built by Hack Clubbers. Give us a star! ⭐

## What is it?

You run `/form` in `#anon-meet` and get matched with a random person who shares your interests. The bot creates a channel where you can talk to them anonymously. It will only be you and the bot in the channel. The bot will relay your messages back and forth between you and the other person. The conversation will end if both of you decide to stop, or after 12 hours of inactivity.

## How do I contribute?

Awesome! You want to contribute? Here's how:

1. Send a DM to me on Slack (HenHen).
2. I'll send over the `.env` file with all the secrets.
3. Fork the repository and start coding.
4. Open a PR when you're ready.

## Here's some stuff we need

- Spotify integration
- Form questions
- Automatic private channel creation when a match is found
- A method to end the conversation
- Finding Matches System™
- Revealing identities
